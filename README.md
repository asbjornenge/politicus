**The name Curious Politicus is inspired bt the 17th century newsbook Mercurious Politicus**  
[Mercurius Politicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurius_Politicus) was a newsbook that was published weekly from June 1650 until the English Restoration in May 1660.
We replaced the latin word Mercurious (messenger) and substitud the english word Curious. Politicus is a latin word for "political". We also take inspiration from the greek concept of "polis" which represented a self-governing community with its laws, institutions, and identity. So loosely you can say the the name "Curious Politicus" means "Curious about self-governing communities" or something like that. Also we think it is quite catchy.
